Depending on how you know me, you either call me Chooi, Je, Je Qin or Jeq. Or [jeqcho](https://codeforces.com/profile/jeqcho). If you don’t, I am eager to meet you and see how we can make great things happen.

I taught myself some code in 2017 (after PT3, for my Malaysians out there), and now I can comfortably handle the technologies to build [some fun things](/).

Maybe you don’t know me and came for the [red buttons](https://red-buttons.chojeq.com), or to [stash toilet papers](https://archive.chojeq.com/coronapaper/). I know, the Internet is weird.

Or maybe you came to [stalk](http://stalk.chojeq.com) me. That’s fine, just remember to give a like or follow.

I host my hobby projects and blog here on [chojeq.com](https://chojeq.com). Try to hack them, or let me know if you have any new ideas. Everything here is released under MIT license, except for this [super important thing](https://chojeq.com/super-important-thing.html).
