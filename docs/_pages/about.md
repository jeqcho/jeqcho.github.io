Depending on how you know me, you either call me Chooi, Je, Je Qin, Jeq, or Jay. Or [jeqcho](https://codeforces.com/profile/jeqcho). If you don’t, I am eager to meet you and see how we can make great things happen.

Maybe you don’t know me and came for the [red buttons](https://red-buttons.chojeq.com), or to [stash toilet papers](https://archive.chojeq.com/coronapaper/). I know, the Internet is weird.

Or maybe you came to [stalk](http://stalk.chojeq.com) me. That’s fine, just remember to give a like or follow.

I host my hobby projects and blog here on [chojeq.com](https://chojeq.com). Try to hack them, or let me know if you have any new ideas. Everything here is released under MIT license, except for this [super important thing](https://chojeq.com/super-important-thing.html).

I value feedback as a way to grow and better serve my friends, family, and community. If you know me, feel free to share your thoughts [here](/feedback). You can stay anonymous, but if you let me know who you are, now or sometime in the future, I would love to treat you to a meal as a thank you!
